There are two types of methods in Java : 

1) User defined methods: 
- The methods which are defined by us and then we call that , are called user defined
methods, for example for factorial we created Factorial() Function. 
2) Inbuilt methods: 
- Inbuilt methods are the pre defined methods that we use in our coding, we dont
write the code for them , they are already pre defined , we just call the method
and use it functionalities.
example-  in Math class we have methods like - max,min,sqrt,pow methods
example- for scanner we use sc.nextInt() method 
These are Inbuilt Methods
