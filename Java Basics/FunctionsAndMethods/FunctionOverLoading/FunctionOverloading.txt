What Is Function OverLoading?? 

-> In same class, Multiple Function with same name name but different parameters

This is a great fuctionality by Java 
Asin Function Overloading we do not have to remember the names of each 
same type functions name, we will give them same name and 
then by the help of parameters the exact Function will be called itself

for example : in a calcultor class , i have created functions for multiply

multiply1 (int a , int b); it takes integers for multiplication
multiply2 (float a , float b); it takes Float for multiplication
multiply3 (double a , double b); it takes Double for multiplication
multiply4 (int a , int b , int c); it takes three numbers for multiplication

but in java we can give them same name , and by the help of parameters 
the exact function will be called so : -

in java this is accepted -> and is called Function Overloading 

multiply (int a , int b); 
multiply (float a , float b); 
multiply (double a , double b); 
multiply (int a , int b , int c); 

** Function over loading checks The PARAMETERS not your RETURNTYPE 
i.e 
int sum (int a , int b);
float sum(int a, int b); 
this is ERROR as parameters are same for different functions

Types: 
1) Function Overloading Using Parameters - int sum(int a , int b) and int sum (int a , int b, int c)
2) Function Overloading Using Data Types - int sum ( int a , int b ) and float sum ( float a, float b)
