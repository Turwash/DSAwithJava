Operators: Symbols that tells Java compiler to perform certain operations.  

sum = a + b , here a and b are operands and + is operator. 
here operation is Addition. 

Types Of Operators In Java : - 
1)Arithmetic operations (Binary/Unary/Ternary)
    Binary -> + , - , * , / , % (Needs two operands), (% is modulo - Remainder operator) 
    Unary -> ++ , -- (Needs one operands)
    Ternary Operator : 
    Ternary Operator Has 3 operands
    Variable = condition ? statement1 : statement2;
    condition checks if true then statement1 executes else statement2
    and result stored in Variable 

    Int larger = (5>3)?5:3;
    String type = (5%2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd" ;
2)Relational operations -> == , != , > , < , >= , <=
    These operators are use to check the relation between the operands 
    == -> operands are equal or not.
    != -> Not equal or Inequality.
    > -> Greater than 
    < -> Less than 
    >== -> Greater than equal to 
    <= -> Less than equal to
3)Logical operations -> 
    Logical AND -> && (Answer is true when both statements are True else False)
    Logical OR -> || (Answer is true if either of the statement is True, Only false when both statements are False )
    Logical NOT -> ! (True will be changed as False and False as True)
4)Bitwise operations (Bit manupulations)
5)Assignments Operations ->
    = -> second operand assign value to first operand, A = 10 or A = B 
    += -> A = A + 10 can be written as A += 10 
    -=
    *=
    /=
