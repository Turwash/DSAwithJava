NestedLoop Start Pattern Printing concept: 

1) 

*
**
***
****

Three steps to tackle the problem : 

1) Lines i.e Row (4) -> Outer loop -> 4 times 
2) number of time star is being printed  -> Inner Loop  (i times)
i.e 1st line 1 star , 2nd line 2 star...
3) What to print? here - * 

2) 

****
***
**
*

for inverted stars, the code logic is
in every line , our star is equal to (numberofline - line + 1)
for(int star = 1; star <= (n-line+1); star++){

3) 

1
12
123
1234

we will directly print our number other than stars

for (int line = 1 ; line <=4 ; line++){

            //inner loop for one line
            for(int number =1; number<=line ; number++){
                System.out.print(number); // we will print number i.e number for count
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }


4) Character Pattern:


A
BC
BCD
BCDE

we will take a char ch = 'A' , variable here and in our nested loop 
we will increase this ch variable , ch++ ; after every loop 
and nested loop will be from 1 to n , n is 4 here

  int n =4;
        char ch = 'A';
        for(int line=1 ; line<=n ; line++){
            for(char alpha = 1 ; alpha<=line ; alpha++){
                System.out.print(ch);
                ch++;
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
