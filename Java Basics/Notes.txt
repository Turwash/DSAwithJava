(1) HOW OUR JAVA ACTUALLY WORKS: 
when we install JDK i.e Java development kit 
it has JRE inside it - Java Run Time Environment  with development tools 
JRE has - JVM (Java virtual machine) + Libraries
with the use of these tools only our Java runs. 

** Code Running Process :- 

Source code (.java) -> Compiler -> Byte code (.class) -> JVM -> Native code(machine code)

** Two stages -
1) Compilaton :- Source code -> Compiler -> Byte code
2) Execution :- Byte code -> JVM -> Native code

** Explaning Everything:

1) Source code : Code written by coder saved with file extension .java
2) Compiler : A prewritten program comes with JDK itself
3) Byte Code : Compiler compiles souce code to byte code
4) JVM : Virtual machine that comes with JDK works for execution, takes byte code 
    and convert it to Native code
5) Native code : A code that can run on any operating system, windows, mac or linux

Thats why java is said to be portable language as the code can run in any platform.
unlike cpp.
