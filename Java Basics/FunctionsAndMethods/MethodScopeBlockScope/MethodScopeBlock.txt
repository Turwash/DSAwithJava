Method Scope : 
-> Method scope means if a variable is defined in a function 
we can use that variable anywhere in the function after the declaration
but not before the declaration.
and if a variable is defined in one function we cant use that in main function or
any other function.
we have to then call it by giving parameters to use that variable not directly


Block Scope : 

-> 
{
    {
    int 45;
    syso(int); // this will not give error
} 
 syso(int) // this will give error because it is out of the braces
}

curly braces are called blocks , so the variables comes under these blocks
there scope becomed that block only , can be used in that block only. 


Class scope is also there which have access modifiers - public , private & protected
will learn in OOPS..
