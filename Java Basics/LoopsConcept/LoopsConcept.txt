Loops In Java:
-> Use to Repeat Work in Code

3 Types of Loops in Java : 

1) While
2) For loop
2) Do while 

1) While loop : 

while (Condition) {
    // do something
    xyz++; 
}

Loop will work until the condition is True. 

2) For Loop : 

for (initialisation ; Condition ; Updation ) {
    // do something 
}

initialisation is done for the counter or say - Iterator (i)

we can use any loop for any question but 
For Loop compress the code, so its a best choice

3) Do While Loop :

do {

} while (something);

here first work is done then condition is applied.
